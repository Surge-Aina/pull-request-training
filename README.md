# 🛠️ Pull Request Practice Repo

Welcome to the **Pull Request Practice** repo!

This repo is for training new team members on how to use GitHub — specifically how to **make a pull request** (PR). Even if you’ve never used GitHub before, don’t worry — just follow the steps below.

---

## 📘 What’s a Pull Request?

A **pull request** is a way to suggest changes to someone else’s code. In our case, you’ll practice by:

- Cloning (copying) this repo
- Making a change by adding your name
- Sending that change back as a **pull request**
- Then I (Jaskaran) will review and merge it in

---

## ✅ Goal

Each team member will add their name to a file called `names.txt` and submit a **pull request**.

---

## 🧪 Example

This is how the file looks after I added my name: Jaskaran

You’ll add yours underneath like this:

Jaskaran
Alex
Taylor
